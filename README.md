# CeroXBot (aka NextBot) â€“ Administrate discord with a bot

## DEPRECATED - The discord api has changed over the time. I started rewriting the bot on the master branch but since I'm now a full-time student and do not use Discord so often anymore, I cannot spend the time to finish it. If you are interested, feel free to fork it or create a pull request

The NextBot is a bot for discord written in Python, that tries to make Discord server administration as easy as possible.
The bot is coded by a student of the 12th grade in germany. It is a combination of the MusicBot written by SexualRhinoceros,
the administration bot DBot by Jacky and my own code. It is still WIP, there are many issues like you cannot shutdown/restart
the bot at the moment with the normal commands.

### How do I set it up?

### Configuration

The main configuration file is `config/options.ini`, but is not included.  Simply make a copy of `example_options.ini` and rename to `options.ini`.
See `example_options.ini` for more information on how to configure it.

### Great, now how do I use it?
To simply run the bot, you should use run.sh (linux/mac) or runbot.bat (windows).
If you want to install the bot permamently to a linux server, use the install.sh.

If you still have problems that seems to be a error in the source code,
post it to issues on GitHub. [CLICK HERE](https://github.com/CeroProgramming/NextBot/issues)
